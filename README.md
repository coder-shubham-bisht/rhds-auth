## Authentication Flow from RHDS to RHEL Client During Login

### Overview
When a user logs in to a RHEL client system that is connected to a Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) via LDAP, several components work together to authenticate the user and initialize their session. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the components involved and their sequence.

---

### Components Involved
- **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)**
- **SSSD (System Security Services Daemon)**
- **NSS (Name Service Switch)**
- **LDAP Protocol**
- **RHDS (Red Hat Directory Server)**
- **TLS/SSL** (for secure LDAP communication)

---

### Step-by-Step Login Sequence

#### 1. User Enters Credentials
- The user inputs a username and password at the login screen (e.g., graphical login manager or terminal).
- These credentials are passed to the authentication stack.

#### 2. PAM Executes Authentication Modules
- PAM configuration (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`) defines how authentication should be handled.
- PAM uses modules like:
  - `pam_sss.so` for SSSD-based authentication
  - `pam_unix.so` for local `/etc/shadow` authentication

#### 3. SSSD Handles Authentication
- If `pam_sss.so` is used, PAM delegates the authentication to SSSD.
- SSSD checks if credentials are cached:
  - If cached: SSSD authenticates offline.
  - If not cached: SSSD connects to RHDS via LDAP.
- SSSD performs a **bind operation** using the user's DN and password to validate credentials.

#### 4. RHDS Verifies Credentials
- RHDS receives the LDAP bind request.
- If the username and password match an entry in RHDS, the bind succeeds.
- If not, authentication fails.

#### 5. SSSD Returns the Result to PAM
- SSSD informs `pam_sss.so` of the result.
- PAM continues based on success/failure of authentication.

#### 6. NSS Resolves User Information
- After successful authentication, the system uses NSS to retrieve user details:
  - UID, GID
  - Home directory
  - Shell
- NSS configuration in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` directs the system to query:
  - Local files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
  - SSSD (which queries RHDS)

#### 7. PAM Session Modules Run
- PAM runs session modules to prepare the environment:
  - `pam_mkhomedir.so` to create a home directory if needed
  - Logging, auditing, Kerberos ticket management, etc.

#### 8. User Session Starts
- With authentication and user setup complete, the system starts the user session:
  - Terminal shell or desktop environment is presented

### Summary Table: Component Sequence

| Step | Component | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Display Manager or `login` | Captures credentials |
| 2 | PAM | Handles auth policy, invokes modules |
| 3 | `pam_sss.so` | Delegates to SSSD |
| 4 | SSSD | Contacts RHDS via LDAP, performs bind |
| 5 | RHDS (LDAP) | Validates password (via bind) |
| 6 | NSS + SSSD | Fetch user info (UID, home, etc.) |
| 7 | PAM Session Modules | Create home dir, initialize session |
| 8 | User Shell/Desktop | Finalize login process |

---

### Optional Enhancements
- **TLS/SSL**: Ensure secure communication between client and RHDS.
- **Kerberos Integration**: If RHDS is integrated with Kerberos, SSSD may also obtain tickets during login.

---

### Configuration Files of Interest
- `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`
- `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
- `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`
- `/etc/pam.d/password-auth`
- `/etc/openldap/ldap.conf` (if using LDAP directly)

# ‚úÖ Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) 12.5 Installation Summary

## üåü Objective
Set up Red Hat Directory Server 12.5 on RHEL 9, based on the new **demodularized packaging** model.

---

## ‚Ü∫ Key Change in RHDS 12.5

| Before (pre-12.5) | Now (RHDS 12.5+) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `389-ds-base` came from RHDS module (`redhat-ds:12`) | `389-ds-base` now comes directly from **RHEL AppStream** |
| Required module enablement | ‚ùå Module enablement **no longer required** |
| RHDS shipped its own version of `389-ds-base` | RHDS now uses the **RHEL-supplied** `389-ds-base` |
| Multiple module streams (RHEL + RHDS) | Simpler, unified stream via AppStream |

---

## ‚úÖ Required Repositories

Enable the following repositories:

```bash
# RHEL Core Repos
subscription-manager repos \
--enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
--enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms

# RHDS 12 Repo (for cockpit and other tools)
subscription-manager repos --enable=dirsrv-12-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
```

---

## ‚ùå Deprecated Command

Do **not** run:
```bash
dnf module enable redhat-ds:12
```
> ‚ùó This is **no longer required** or relevant for RHDS 12.5.

---

## üìÜ Install Required Packages

```bash
dnf install 389-ds-base cockpit-389-ds
```

- `389-ds-base`: Now delivered via **AppStream**
- `cockpit-389-ds`: Still delivered via **dirsrv-12-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms**

---

## üîç Verify Package Sources

After installation, verify source repositories:

```bash
dnf info 389-ds-base
# ‚Üí Should show: From repo : rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms

dnf info cockpit-389-ds
# ‚Üí Should show: From repo : dirsrv-12-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
```

# ‚öñÔ∏è RHDS: `.inf` File vs Interactive Install

## üìÑ What is `.inf` in RHDS?
In Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS), a `.inf` file is a **plain-text configuration file** used to automate the creation of a Directory Server instance. It is consumed by the `dscreate` command to run **non-interactive installations**.

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Full Form
While `.inf` stands for **information file**, in the RHDS context, it specifically represents a **configuration file for automated instance setup**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Comparison: `.inf` vs Interactive Install

| Feature                   | `.inf` File Install (`dscreate from-file`)         | Interactive Install (`dscreate interactive`)        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Mode                      | Non-interactive (scripted)                         | Manual (user input required)                        |
| User Input                | None after creating the `.inf` file                | Yes, during setup prompts                           |
| Best Use Case             | Automated deployments, scripting                   | One-off setups, manual configuration                |
| Customization             | Predefined in the file                             | Real-time input during wizard                       |
| Reproducibility           | High (file can be reused multiple times)           | Low (manual entry each time)                        |
| File Format               | INI-style config file                              | Not applicable                                      |

---

## üìÅ Sample `.inf` File

```ini
[general]
config_version = 2

[slapd]
instance_name = myds
root_password = redhat123
suffix = dc=example,dc=com
root_dn = cn=Directory Manager
port = 389
secure_port = 636

[backend-userroot]
sample_entries = yes
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Install using the `.inf` file:
```bash
dscreate from-file myds.inf
```

---

## üìà Summary
- Use `.inf` when you need consistent, automated, or repeatable RHDS deployments.
- Use `interactive` for a guided, manual setup.
- Both approaches use the `dscreate` tool provided by `389-ds-base`.

---

Let me know if you want help generating a custom `.inf` file for your environment.
